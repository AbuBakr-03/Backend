    Simple function to download AI models from R2 cloud storage

    What this does:
    1. Connects to your Cloudflare R2 storage (where you uploaded the models)
    2. Creates a folder on the server to store the models
    3. Downloads each AI model file if it doesn't already exist
    4. Your Django app can then use these models for analysis

    # This is like logging into your cloud storage account
    # We use the same credentials you already have for media files

"""
FLOW EXPLANATION - What happens when this function runs:

1. üîó CONNECT TO CLOUD STORAGE
   - Your server connects to Cloudflare R2 (like logging into Google Drive)
   - Uses your existing R2 credentials from settings

2. üìÅ PREPARE LOCAL STORAGE  
   - Creates a folder on the server to store AI models
   - Usually /tmp/models on Render servers

3. üìã CHECK WHAT'S NEEDED
   - Lists the 4 AI model files that need to be downloaded
   - Each file serves a specific purpose in emotion analysis

4. ‚¨áÔ∏è  DOWNLOAD PROCESS (for each file):
   - Check: Does this file already exist on server? 
   - If YES: Skip it (saves time and bandwidth)
   - If NO: Download it from cloud storage to server
   - Verify: Confirm download worked by checking file size

5. ‚úÖ COMPLETION
   - All 4 AI models now exist on your server
   - Your InterviewAnalysisService can load and use them
   - Users can now upload videos and get AI analysis results

REAL WORLD ANALOGY:
Think of this like downloading apps to your phone:
- Your phone (server) needs certain apps (AI models) to work
- You download them once from the app store (R2 storage)  
- Once downloaded, you can use the apps anytime
- You don't need to download them again unless you delete them

THE RESULT:
After this runs, your server has all the AI models it needs to:
- Analyze facial expressions in interview videos
- Analyze emotions from audio
- Generate confidence scores
- Determine if candidates should be hired or rejected
